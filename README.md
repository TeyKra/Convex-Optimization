# Convex-Optimization

## Subject A: Application of Optimization Techniques to a Concrete Machine Learning Problem

### Objective
Build a model to solve a machine learning task (classification, regression, clustering, recommender system, etc.) on a specific dataset of your choice. Evaluate this model — ideally with a comparison to existing work — and detail your approach. Focus your analysis on the optimization techniques implemented by the machine learning algorithms (SVM, SGD, neural networks, etc.) you choose to use.
